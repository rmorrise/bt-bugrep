# RogueTech - Blackjack weapons go to zero damage after being fired

Screencap and log files: [https://github.com/rmorrise/bt-bugrep/tree/master/rt-zero-damage]

## Description of issue

See: [https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/79?tab=bugs]

## Reliability: 100%

## Steps to reproduce:

1) Load game from the provided save file - it should be the Blackjack's turn.
2) Attack the Commando with all weapons.
3) Play through to the Blackjack's next turn.

The Blackjack's weapons all show as having 0 damage.

I can consistently reproduce this issue on any autocannon or gauss rifle, on any 'mech that I've tested so far. (Even starting a new campaign.)
